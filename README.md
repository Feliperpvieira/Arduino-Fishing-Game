# ðŸŽ£ Arduino and Processing Fishing game
Fishing game using Arduino, Processing and a Water Level Sensor.\
The idea of this project was to build a fishing minigame, similar to the ones found in popular games, such as Club Penguin and Mario Party, but this time using real water and a physical fishing rod to control it, bringing the virtual and physical spaces closes together.
