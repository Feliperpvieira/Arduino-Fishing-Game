# ðŸŽ£ Arduino and Processing Fishing game
Fishing game using Arduino, Processing and a Water Level Sensor.\
The idea of this project was to build a fishing minigame, similar to the ones found in popular games, such as Club Penguin and Mario Party, but this time using real water and a physical fishing rod to control it, bringing the virtual and physical spaces closer together.

#### Circuit and construction

The circuit is simple, you need to connect the sensor to the Arduino using a resistor between the input and ground cables.

- ðŸ”µ Blue cable: 5V (Arduino) -> Water level sensor
- ðŸŸ£ Purple cable: Ground/GND (Arduino) -> Resistor
- ðŸŸ¢ Green cable: Digital input (Arduino) -> Resistor -> Water Level Sensor

You can see in more details the circuit and the fishing rod in the following video:

The fishing rod was built using pieces of 3mm MDF. They were cut by hand using a tabletop saw; the piece's shape was then made with a bench sander, including the rounded borders. The holes were drilled using different sized bits, one for the sensor and the other, a smaller one, to attach the 2 pieces together. Everything was then varnished to protect the wood from water.\
Each piece is roughly [7.5 X 1.5 inches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47862856/179283887-51402001-d399-4b1a-be23-ff17b1163aba.jpg).
